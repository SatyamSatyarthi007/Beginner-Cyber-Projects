## 📌 What is a Keylogger?

A **keylogger** (keystroke logger) is a type of monitoring software that records keyboard input.  
While often associated with malicious activity, keyloggers also have legitimate and ethical applications such as:

- 🖥️ System monitoring (on systems you own)
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Parental control tools
- 🏢 Employee monitoring (with proper consent and disclosure)
- 🎓 Cybersecurity research & education

This project is designed strictly for **learning and defensive security awareness**.
